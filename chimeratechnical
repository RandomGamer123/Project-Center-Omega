Technical for next round:
<br>You have to set your account's profile picture to the image at <a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/633988283457863680/738475748746199160/ThingAN597.png">this link</a>, and your account's nickname in both the Chimera TWOW Server and the TWOW Central server to <code>! I did this to get a 2% boost</code>, and your account's custom status to <code>This custom status is solely to get a 2% boost in a mini-twow. Yeah. That's how desperate I am.</code> from when you submit the first iteration of your response until when voting is closed.
<br>If you complete a technical where you are the only person to complete it (excluding this technical itself to prevent paradoxes), and also completed Q04, you will automatically be disqualified from completing this technical. (Blame Q05 for this). 
<br>"Your account" is defined as the Discord account that is on the Chimera TWOW server and has the alive contestant role. If multiple accounts have the role or you are an off-server contestant, your account is defined as the account from which you submitted your response last round from.
<br>If you submitted your response last round through a non-Discord medium or are not on the Chimera TWOW server, you will be automatically given this technical for free.
<br>Please note that you will be rickrolled within 5 seconds of loading this page.
